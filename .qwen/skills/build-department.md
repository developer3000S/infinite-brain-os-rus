# build-department

Use this skill to create or upgrade a real department under `departments/`.

The output is not a new ontology primitive. It is a durable operating assembly surface over
existing entities: intake, namespaces, agents, workflows, tools, metrics, projects, and
human review gates, plus a charter that states what the department is optimizing for.

Onboard a new department using [[department-onboarding-guide]] (the sequence and the alignment
checklist that ties it into the OODA and wager-ledger system); how it then runs day to day is the
operating guide [[department-operating-guide]] (its slice of the board via `owning_department_id`, the
two intake lanes, the disposition-to-wager-to-verdict lifecycle). Build the department so it passes the
onboarding checklist and its head conforms to both.

## Use when

- a business or operating function should become a first-class AI shadow department
- an existing department scaffold needs real ownership, workflows, tools, or handoffs
- a shared platform capability should become an explicit department instead of being
  redefined in every domain team

## Do not use when

- the operator actually needs a knowledge namespace; use [[build-knowledge-base]]
- the work is only to add one agent or one workflow inside an existing department
- the function is too small or too vague to deserve its own assembly surface

## Build steps

1. State the department's business function and owned result.
2. Decide whether it is a domain department, a platform department, or a stewardship
   department.
3. Decide the external scope posture:
   - `shared-platform`
   - `internal-product`
   - `client-scoped`
   - `brand-scoped`
   - `multi-party`
4. If externally scoped, declare `party_slugs`, plus `client_slug` and `brand_slug` when one
   primary commercial scope dominates.
5. Define the intake boundary.
6. Define the head-of-department agent.
7. Link the core namespaces, workflows, tools, and review gates.
8. For every KPI set, decide the data posture:
   - backed by a department-owned Data System namespace
   - backed by a shared Data System namespace
   - or explicitly provisional with `live`, `manual`, or `not-wired` status per metric
9. Decide whether the department should consume a shared platform department instead of
   owning its own GitHub, CI/CD, or observability stack.
10. Write `CHARTER.md` with mission, north star, owned outcomes, goals, KPIs, constraints,
   related entities, escalation rules, and reporting cadence.
11. Define the daily update and rollup posture, author `departments/<slug>/daily-briefing.md` from the
   `departments/personal-health/daily-briefing.md` template (morning push, summary band plus detail), and
   register the department's cadence and daily briefing in `departments/operations-register.md` with
   `approval: operator-pending`. The operator approves per-department to activate it. See
   `knowledge/ai-architecture/playbooks/unified-operations-register.md`.
12. State the current open gaps honestly.
13. If the department lacks a head agent or workflow pattern, create them.
14. Copy `departments/_template/INDEX.md` and `CHARTER.md`; include the explicit Runtime Mapping block
    (the 10 `_system/department-runtime-contract.md` fields) so the Paperclip projection has one source.
15. Split the work into two named projects up front: `projects/<dept>-buildout/PLAN.md` (durable
    artifacts to the ceiling) and `projects/<dept>-activation/PLAN.md` (operator values, live
    human-in-loop, Paperclip projection, L1 pilot). See [[build-out-a-department]] for the split and the
    builder gotchas.

## Quality checks

- the department owns one clear function
- the assembly surface is explicit in `departments/<slug>/INDEX.md`
- if externally scoped, `scope_class`, `party_slugs`, and any primary `client_slug` or `brand_slug`
  are explicit and match the relevant `parties/` records
- the charter is explicit in `departments/<slug>/CHARTER.md` with `type: "Charter"`
- the head-of-department agent is defined or explicitly deferred, and its `tools` match what it actually
  does (add Bash or Task if it runs workflows or delegates), with its owned entities linked by wikilink
- the head reports to the fleet coordinator by default (`reports_to: fleet-coordinator` in the Runtime
  Mapping; `reportsTo: fleet-coordinator` in the Paperclip projection), so the department is wired into
  the fleet apex. The chief-of-staff is the only exception: a protected peer reporting to the operator,
  syncing with the fleet coordinator, never commanded by it. See
  `entities/rules/department-head-reporting-contract.md`.
- the Runtime Mapping block (10 fields) is explicit in the INDEX
- tools and workflows are linked, not implied; shared doctrine is referenced by full path or wikilink,
  never a bare relative path from `departments/`
- the intake boundary is explicit
- the KPI layer either links to a Data System or names the instrumentation gap explicitly
- shared platform dependencies are not reinvented unnecessarily
- the department's cadence and daily briefing are registered in `departments/operations-register.md`
  (`departments/<slug>/daily-briefing.md` exists; the register block carries an `approval` stamp), and the
  reconcile check `_system/checks/operations-register-reconcile-check.sh` is clean
- the per-department acceptance gate is run (architecture conformance, end-to-end function, runs on
  Paperclip at L1, written built-but-not-working gap list) or explicitly deferred into the activation
  project, per [[build-out-a-department]]. Built does not equal working.
