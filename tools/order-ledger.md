# Tool: Order Ledger (Shop Platform Order-Export API)

The bounded capability behind every order question at Emberline Candle Studio: the
shop platform's order-export endpoint. This node is the durable pointer; the
implementation is the shop platform's API, not anything in this repo.

## Interface contract

- `GET {SHOP_API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/orders/export`
- Query: `from` and `to` (ISO dates) or `days` (integer lookback)
- Query: `format=csv` (default) or `format=json`
- Returns one row per order line: order id, date, SKU, quantity, unit price
- Auth: API key in the request header

## Credentials

By reference only. The API key lives in the secret manager under the reference name
`shop-platform-api-key`. The n8n engine holds its own copy as a named credential.
No secret value ever enters git.

## Who may call it

- [[automation-order-export-digest]], the weekly deterministic digest flow
- Agentic sessions running the weekly studio review, via the pointer in
  [[data-orders-ledger]]

This tool is read-only. Nothing in the brain writes orders back to the shop platform.

## Boundary

The tool answers "what sold, when, in what quantity." It does not own pricing
decisions, inventory truth, or customer data beyond the order line. It is classified
`contract_status: pointer-only` because one read-only endpoint with five query
parameters needs no deeper trust surface. If a deeper call contract ever becomes
necessary, it gets its own `knowledge/order-ledger-tool-contract/` namespace; this
root entry stays shallow.
