# AI Architecture Swarm Launch Governance

## Summary

Swarm execution is allowed only as a governed routing path from a canonical parent
task into a specialized sprint package, with human approval and bounded closeout
writeback.

## Content

Required launch posture:

1. canonical task exists and is structurally valid
2. `execution_mode: swarm` is explicit
3. approval block exists on the task
4. file-backed approval receipt exists
5. receipt is human-granted, fingerprint-matched, and not expired

Operator outcomes:

- `blocked` when the task is not yet launchable
- `denied` when approval explicitly rejects launch
- `launched` only after the gate validates fully

Launch writes only bounded routing metadata and sprint linkage. Closeout writes back
only distilled planning truth:

- task status
- completion date
- sprint status
- latest summary path
- closeout outcome and evidence

This pattern keeps `swarms/Sprints` durable and useful without making sprint folders
the canonical planner.

## Evidence

Primary sources:

- internal build records (not shipped)

## Edges

- `implements` the planning ladder by showing how the parent task remains the anchor.
- `constrains` the PM-agent posture because routing may recommend swarm but may not
  bypass the launch gate.

## Notes

Keep this node focused on the reusable contract. Example task IDs, sprint IDs, and
receipt paths are evidence, not the doctrine itself.
