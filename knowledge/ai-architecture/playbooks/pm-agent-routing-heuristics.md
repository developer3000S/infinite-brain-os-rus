# AI Architecture PM Agent Routing Heuristics

## Summary

The PM-agent should choose the lightest safe execution mode, but substantial
multi-step work should still route to `swarm` readily because that is the proven
high-capacity substrate in this doctrine line.

## Content

Evaluate these signals before choosing a mode:

1. acceptance criteria complexity
2. expected decomposition size
3. repo and domain span
4. review and handoff count
5. context-window pressure
6. need for durable execution artifacts
7. whether a matching workflow or swarm pattern already exists

Mode guidance:

- choose `manual` when judgment is primary and automation adds little value
- choose `workflow` when the path is deterministic and contract-heavy
- choose `agent` when one bounded context can complete the work cleanly
- choose `swarm` when parallel lanes, staged checkpoints, or multi-role coordination
  are materially present

Borderline rule:

If the work is clearly substantial but reuse and scope are still ambiguous, bias
toward `swarm` and make the missing prerequisites explicit rather than forcing the
task into a brittle single-agent path.

Trust rule:

Routing output should always include:

- chosen mode
- short rationale
- missing prerequisites
- approval posture when `swarm` is selected

## Evidence

Primary sources:

- internal build records (not shipped)

## Edges

- `implements` the PM-agent posture by turning the advisory role into repeatable
  routing signals.
- `bounded_by` swarm governance because routing never overrides approval.

## Notes

This playbook captures the reusable signal set, not the full implementation details of
one trial runner.

A consequential routing choice is a bet on how best to execute the work, and in the wager-ledger
lifecycle that commitment carries a pre-registered wager scored later against an exogenous metric. The
PM-agent stays advisory and human-gated; the wager records the prediction it implies. See
`_system/wager-ledger-rules.md` and [[department-operating-guide]].
