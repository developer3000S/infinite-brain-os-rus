# AI Architecture PM Agent Posture

## Summary

The PM-agent should route work visibly across `manual`, `workflow`, `agent`, and
`swarm`, but it remains an advisory and preparation layer rather than a launch
authority.

## Content

Settled rules:

- choose the lowest-cost safe mode
- treat `swarm` as the normal path for substantial multi-agent work
- prefer reuse of an existing swarm pattern when it fits
- scope a new sprint when risks, boundaries, or architecture are materially new
- emit visible routing artifacts, rationale, and missing prerequisites
- do not create approval receipts or invoke launch without human approval already in place

Current readiness posture:

- bounded prototype complete
- hardening and limited operator trial complete
- useful for the next limited batch
- not ready for broad unattended use

## Evidence

Primary sources:

- internal build records (not shipped)

## Edges

- `bounded_by` the swarm-governance playbook because PM routing never overrides the
  launch gate.
- `aligned_with` the standing-runtime posture because both preserve visible,
  human-gated authority.

## Notes

This node should be revisited if a later sprint changes trial readiness or expands the
PM-agent beyond advisory mode.
