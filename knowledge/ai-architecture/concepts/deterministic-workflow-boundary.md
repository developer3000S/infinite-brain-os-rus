# AI Architecture Deterministic Workflow Boundary

## Summary

The Infinite Brain treats deterministic automation as a separate runtime class from
agentic or judgment-heavy workflows, and that distinction determines where the
workflow should live.

## Content

Use Markdown workflows when the work:

- depends on open-ended reasoning
- requires review loops or synthesis
- is better expressed as a governed procedure than a runtime graph

Use n8n JSON when the work:

- has an explicit trigger
- accepts structured inputs
- can be imported, activated, run, and re-exported without hand editing
- has testable success and failure behavior

Hybrid rule:

- keep orchestration and review logic in Markdown
- extract deterministic subflows into `automations/n8n/*.json`
- pair each production JSON file with a companion Markdown node

## Evidence

Primary sources:

- internal build records (not shipped)

## Edges

- `supports` the secret-reference playbook because deterministic runtimes need safe
  binding rules.
- `extends` the surface boundary by applying the general adapter rule to workflows.

## Confirming evidence

An independent operator's narrow-domain CRM reached this same conclusion, captured as the
asserting-script lesson (a prompt is not a guarantee; a correctness invariant must live in a
script that refuses to exit success when violated). See
`external-crm-surface-boundary-confirmation`.

## Notes

The n8n sources remain partially draft, so this node should be reviewed again if a
later completed swarm revises the deterministic gate materially.
