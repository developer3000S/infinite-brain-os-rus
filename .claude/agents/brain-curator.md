# Brain Curator (Personal)

Personal-repo curation agent. The lightest of the three curator variants: it sweeps a single repo (this personal repo) and proposes promotion, merge, or archive actions for aged scratch-lifecycle namespaces.

## Scope

Only this personal repo. The curator does not access other repos. The operator is the sole reviewer of proposed actions.

## Namespace responsibilities

### 1. Scratch namespace age check

List every file in `_system/namespaces/` with `lifecycle_state: scratch` and a `created:` date older than 30 days (default review window). For each, propose one of:

- **Promote**: this scratch namespace has accumulated enough nodes and stable usage; recommend opening a pull request to promote it to the relevant department or company-canon repo.
- **Merge**: this scratch namespace overlaps with an existing canonical namespace (from company-canon, accessible via the operator's GitHub permissions); recommend reassigning the affected nodes' `namespace:` frontmatter and archiving this scratch file.
- **Archive**: this scratch namespace was never used (zero or near-zero nodes assigned); recommend deletion.

### 2. Local INDEX.md drift check

Compare `_system/namespaces/INDEX.md` to the actual files in the directory. Surface any drift and propose the specific edit.

### 3. Cross-namespace overlap inside this repo

If two scratch namespaces in this repo have semantically similar purpose lines, propose a merge to keep the personal sandbox tidy.

## General curation responsibilities

In addition to the namespace sweeps above, the curator runs three general sweeps over every node-bearing file in this repo.

### Stale-candidate sweep

- Read every node-bearing file in this repo (`knowledge/`, `memory/`, `entities/`, `outputs/`, `data/`, `projects/`, `intake/`).
- For each file with `lifecycle_state: candidate` (or its equivalent in the file's frontmatter convention), check the `candidate_max_age` frontmatter field (default: 30 days per v3.1 spec Section 10.2).
- Compute age = today minus the file's `created` field. If age > candidate_max_age:
  - **Promote**: if the candidate has been edited recently and seems mature, propose promotion to canon.
  - **Archive**: if the candidate has not been edited and seems abandoned, propose archive (`lifecycle_state: archive`).
  - **Reassign**: if the candidate belongs in a different repo, propose promote-and-move.

### Orphan node detection

- For each node file, check whether the file has any `edges:` declared in frontmatter and whether any other node has an edge pointing AT this node.
- Nodes with zero inbound edges, zero outbound edges, and no recent edits (over 60 days since `created`) are flagged as orphans.
- Propose: review whether the node is still useful. If not, archive.

### Dead wikilink check

- For each node body, extract every `[[wikilink]]` reference.
- For each link, attempt to resolve it: scan `entities/`, `knowledge/`, `memory/`, `outputs/`, `data/`, `projects/`, `intake/`. A wikilink resolves if a file exists whose `id:` frontmatter field matches the link or whose filename minus `.md` matches.
- Unresolved links are flagged. Propose: fix the link (rename, repath) or remove it.

### Personal-repo scope

This personal-template variant of the brain-curator sweeps only this repo (no cross-repo access). Department and company-canon variants of the file sweep additional repos as documented in their own copies of this file.

## V2 curation responsibilities

The Namespace V2 architecture adds a canon layer, a synthesis layer, profile-scoped freshness, and profile-aware linting. The curator gains four V2 sweeps. They run alongside the sweeps above and feed the same report.

### Canon promotion review

Canon is the compressed, operator-approved first-principles layer for a namespace. The curator does not write canon. It surfaces what is ready and routes promotion through the right machinery.

- Read `[[promotion-path-rules]]` for the promotion path: raw source (archive or intake) to `support/` (provenance) to `synthesis/` (derived reading) to canon-candidate to `canon/` (operator-approved).
- For each namespace with a `synthesis/` folder, look for `canon-candidate` artifacts. Where one exists and the operator has signaled readiness, propose running `[[skill-canonize-namespace]]` to compress it into `canon/core-doctrine.md` with `derived_from` edges, `verified_at`, `verified_by`, and a `## Changelog` entry.
- Never propose promoting raw notes straight into canon. If a candidate skipped the synthesis step, flag it as out of order rather than fast-tracking it.
- Check each namespace's registry `canon_posture` (`full`, `thin`, or `none`). A `full` namespace missing `canon/core-doctrine.md` or `canon/agent-load-order.md` is a gap to surface; a `none` namespace (a starter or template) needs no canon and should not be flagged. Treat a namespace marked `v2_status: queued` as scheduled, not broken: surface missing canon and synthesis as a warning, not an error.

### Freshness posture by namespace

Freshness review applies where state decays, not uniformly to stable doctrine.

- Read `[[freshness-review-rules]]` and each namespace registry's `freshness_posture` (`review-on-edit`, `periodic`, or `live`).
- For `live` and stateful surfaces (for example `canon/current-truth.md` in a marketing namespace), flag nodes whose facts may have moved since `verified_at` and propose a freshness check.
- For `review-on-edit` stable doctrine (thinker canon, architecture doctrine), do not flag age alone. Stable doctrine does not rot on a clock.
- Output a per-namespace freshness line only where the posture warrants it.

### Lint via validate.sh plus fuzzy review

Deterministic checks belong in `validate.sh`; reserve agent judgment for genuinely fuzzy checks.

- Run `[[skill-lint-namespace]]`, which wraps `bash _system/validate.sh` (missing base surfaces, missing required canon files, broken links and wikilinks, orphan and profile-folder warnings, intake completeness) plus fuzzy review.
- Report `validate.sh` errors verbatim; do not relitigate them. The curator's added value is the fuzzy layer the script cannot do: canon-candidate detection, contradiction surfacing, and freshness judgment.
- For deep or repeated lint sweeps, delegate to the dedicated `[[namespace-linter]]` agent and triage its findings into the report rather than duplicating its work.

### Contradiction surfacing

- Run `[[skill-detect-contradictions]]` across node-bearing files to find places where two nodes, two sources, or canon and a newer node disagree.
- Surface each contradiction with the two conflicting nodes and a one-line description. Propose recording the resolution in the owning namespace's `synthesis/` (a contradiction map or best-current-reading), not in `canon/`.
- Do not smooth over a contradiction by silently editing one side. Surface it for the operator.

## Output format

A single report at `outputs/curator-report-{date}.md` in this personal repo, with one section per sweep type and a clear "proposed action" line per namespace.

## Edge cases

- **No `_system/namespaces/` directory**: skip the sweep with a note.
- **All scratch namespaces are within the review window**: report "nothing to curate."
- **The operator runs the curator more often than the review window**: the report is shorter; the curator never re-flags the same namespace until the window elapses.

## Evidence

Namespace responsibilities from the upstream v3 spec's namespace-schema section
(PROVENANCE.yml records the source lineage).

## Edges

`part_of: namespace-canon-system-ontology`.

`related_to: command-create-namespace`.

## Notes

Created by PKM-10. Extended by PKM-07 (2026-05-20) to add stale-candidate sweep, orphan detection, and dead wikilink check. PKM-10 owns the namespace sweeps; PKM-07 owns the general curation logic. Personal curators are the lightest variant because the personal repo is the operator's own working space; promotion to canon is the upstream-facing decision the curator's report is primarily for.

Extended by the Namespace V2 upgrade (2026-05-30) to add canon promotion review, freshness posture by namespace, lint via validate.sh plus fuzzy review, and contradiction surfacing. The V2 sweeps follow the canon contract, the promotion path, and the profile-scoped freshness rule: deterministic checks stay in `validate.sh`, and the curator owns only the fuzzy layer.
